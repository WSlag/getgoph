# Contract Modal Sign Button Fix

## Issue
**Shipper cannot sign the contract even though they haven't signed yet.**

### Symptoms:
- Contract shows: Shipper = Pending ⏱️, Trucker = Signed ✅
- Modal bottom shows: "Waiting for other party to sign" (incorrect)
- Expected: "Sign Contract" button should appear for the shipper

---

## Root Cause

**Location**: `frontend/src/components/modals/ContractModal.jsx:61-62`

The modal was checking user roles using nested object references:
```javascript
const isListingOwner = currentUser?.id === listing?.userId;
const isBidder = currentUser?.id === bid?.bidderId;
```

**Problem**: The `listing?.userId` or `bid?.bidderId` might be undefined or not populated when the contract object doesn't include the full nested `Bid` and `Listing` objects.

This caused:
- `isListingOwner` = false (because `listing?.userId` was undefined)
- `isBidder` = false (because `bid?.bidderId` was undefined)
- `isShipper` = false (incorrect!)
- `hasUserSigned` checked `truckerSignature` instead of `shipperSignature`
- Since trucker already signed, modal thought current user (shipper) had signed
- So it showed "Waiting for other party" instead of "Sign Contract" button

---

## Solution

**Use the contract's direct fields** instead of nested objects:

```javascript
// ✅ FIXED - Use contract fields with fallback
const isListingOwner = currentUser?.id === (contract.listingOwnerId || listing?.userId);
const isBidder = currentUser?.id === (contract.bidderId || bid?.bidderId);
```

**Why this works**:
- `contract.listingOwnerId` and `contract.bidderId` are always present on contract objects
- These fields are set when the contract is created (backend)
- Fallback to nested objects for backwards compatibility

---

## Logic Flow

### For Cargo Listing (this case):
```
Shipper = Listing Owner (posted the cargo)
Trucker = Bidder (bid on the cargo)

Current user is Shipper:
  - isListingOwner = true (matches contract.listingOwnerId)
  - isBidder = false
  - isShipper = isCargo ? true : false = true ✅
  - hasUserSigned = contract.shipperSignature ✅
  - otherPartySigned = contract.truckerSignature ✅

If shipper hasn't signed:
  - hasUserSigned = false
  - otherPartySigned = true (trucker signed)
  - Show "Sign Contract" button ✅
```

## Files Modified

**File**: `frontend/src/components/modals/ContractModal.jsx`

### Change 1: Use Contract Direct Fields (Lines 61-63)
```javascript
// Before:
const isListingOwner = currentUser?.id === listing?.userId;
const isBidder = currentUser?.id === bid?.bidderId;

// After:
const isListingOwner = currentUser?.id === (contract.listingOwnerId || listing?.userId);
const isBidder = currentUser?.id === (contract.bidderId || bid?.bidderId);
```

### Change 2: Added Debug Logging (Lines 77-91)
Added console.log to help verify the fix is working correctly.

---

## Testing Steps

1. **Open the contract as Shipper** (listing owner)
2. **Check browser console** for debug output:
   ```javascript
   ContractModal Debug: {
     contractId: "...",
     currentUserId: "...",
     listingOwnerId: "...",  // Should match currentUserId
     bidderId: "...",        // Different from currentUserId
     isCargo: true,
     isListingOwner: true,   // ✅ Should be true
     isBidder: false,        // ✅ Should be false
     isShipper: true,        // ✅ Should be true
     hasUserSigned: false,   // ✅ Should be false
     otherPartySigned: true, // ✅ Should be true (trucker signed)
     shipperSig: undefined,  // No signature yet
     truckerSig: "..."       // Trucker's signature present
   }
   ```
3. **Verify "Sign Contract" button appears** at the bottom
4. **Click "Sign Contract"** and complete the signing flow

## Expected Behavior After Fix

### Before Shipper Signs:
- ✅ Modal shows "Sign Contract" button
- ✅ Shipper section shows ⏱️ Pending
- ✅ Trucker section shows ✅ Signed

### After Shipper Signs:
- ✅ Contract status changes to "Active" (signed)
- ✅ Shipment is created with tracking number
- ✅ Both parties are notified
- ✅ Contract moves to "Active" tab in list

## Related Fixes

This is the **third fix** in the contract signing flow:

1. ✅ **ContractsView.jsx** - Fixed signature status in list view
2. ✅ **ContractModal.jsx** - Fixed timestamp formatting (Invalid Date)
3. ✅ **ContractModal.jsx** - Fixed sign button visibility (this fix)

All three components now use consistent role detection logic matching the backend.

---

## Backend Reference

The backend correctly uses contract fields:

**File**: `functions/src/api/contracts.js`
```javascript
const listingOwnerId = contract.listingOwnerId;
const bidderId = contract.bidderId;
const isCargo = contract.listingType === 'cargo';

if (isCargo) {
  isShipper = listingOwnerId === userId;
  isTrucker = bidderId === userId;
} else {
  isTrucker = listingOwnerId === userId;
  isShipper = bidderId === userId;
}
```

The frontend modal now matches this exactly! ✅

## Cleanup Note

After confirming the fix works, you can remove the debug console.log from lines 77-91 in ContractModal.jsx.
