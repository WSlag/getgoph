# Security Fix: Admin Privilege Escalation Vulnerability

**Status:** ✅ FIXED
**Severity:** 🔴 CRITICAL
**Date Fixed:** 2026-02-11
**CVE:** N/A (Internal Discovery)

---

## Executive Summary

A critical security vulnerability was identified and fixed in the Firestore security rules that could have allowed any authenticated user to grant themselves admin privileges during account creation. This vulnerability has been patched with a defense-in-depth approach including:

1. ✅ Enhanced Firestore security rules
2. ✅ Real-time security monitoring (Cloud Function trigger)
3. ✅ Daily admin account audits (Scheduled function)
4. ✅ Enhanced audit logging

---

## Vulnerability Details

### The Problem

**Vulnerable Code** (firestore.rules:18):
```javascript
allow create: if isOwner(uid);  // ❌ No content validation
```

This rule only validated that the authenticated user ID matched the document ID being created. It did NOT validate the document content, allowing attackers to set `isAdmin: true` or `role: "admin"` during initial user creation.

### Attack Scenario

```javascript
// Malicious user during registration:
await setDoc(doc(db, 'users', currentUser.uid), {
  displayName: "Attacker",
  email: "attacker@example.com",
  role: "admin",        // ❌ No protection on create!
  isAdmin: true,        // ❌ No protection on create!
});
```

### Impact

An attacker with admin privileges would have complete access to:

- 💰 **Financial Data:** All wallet balances, transactions, platform fees
- 💳 **Payment System:** Approve/reject payments, credit any wallet
- 👥 **User Management:** Suspend/activate users, disable authentication
- 🔐 **Privilege Escalation:** Grant admin to additional accounts
- 📄 **Contract Management:** View/manipulate all contracts and shipments
- 🚨 **Fraud Bypass:** Approve payments flagged as fraudulent

---

## The Fix

### 1. Firestore Security Rules Enhancement

**Fixed Code** (firestore.rules:18-22):
```javascript
// SECURITY FIX: Prevent privilege escalation during user creation
allow create: if isOwner(uid)
  && (!request.resource.data.keys().hasAny(['isAdmin', 'role'])
      || (request.resource.data.get('isAdmin', false) == false
          && request.resource.data.get('role', 'shipper') in ['shipper', 'trucker', 'broker']));
```

**What this does:**
- ✅ Users can still create their own documents
- ✅ Prevents setting `isAdmin: true` during creation
- ✅ Restricts `role` to valid values: `shipper`, `trucker`, `broker`
- ✅ Backward compatible (allows missing fields)
- ✅ Defense-in-depth validation

### 2. Real-Time Security Monitor

**New Cloud Function:** `validateUserCreation`

Monitors every user document creation and:
- 🛡️ Detects if `isAdmin: true` or `role: 'admin'` is set
- ⚡ Immediately revokes unauthorized privileges
- 🔒 Disables the account pending investigation
- 📝 Logs security incident to `securityIncidents` collection

**Location:** `functions/index.js` (lines 813-860)

### 3. Daily Admin Account Audit

**New Scheduled Function:** `auditAdminAccounts`

Runs daily at 2 AM Manila time to:
- 🔍 Find all accounts with admin privileges
- ✅ Verify each has proper authorization trail (`adminGrantedBy` field)
- 🚨 Flag accounts missing audit trail
- 📊 Log results to `securityIncidents` collection

**Location:** `functions/index.js` (lines 862-910)

### 4. Enhanced Audit Logging

**Updated Function:** `adminToggleAdmin`

Enhanced logging now includes:
- 📍 IP address of the admin performing the action
- 🖥️ User agent (browser/device info)
- 🔄 Previous role and isAdmin status
- 🔄 New role and isAdmin status

**Location:** `functions/src/api/admin.js` (lines 288-332)

## Verification & Testing

### Manual Testing Checklist

- [ ] Test normal user registration (should succeed)
- [ ] Attempt to set `isAdmin: true` during creation (should fail with PERMISSION_DENIED)
- [ ] Attempt to set `role: "admin"` during creation (should fail with PERMISSION_DENIED)
- [ ] Test valid role values: shipper, trucker, broker (should succeed)
- [ ] Attempt to update `isAdmin` after creation (should fail with PERMISSION_DENIED)
- [ ] Verify legitimate admin grant via Cloud Function (should succeed)
- [ ] Verify security monitor triggers on bypass attempt
- [ ] Verify daily audit runs successfully

### Automated Testing

Run the test script:
```bash
# Start Firebase emulators
firebase emulators:start --only firestore,auth

# In another terminal, run tests
node test-security-fixes.cjs
```

**Expected result:** All tests should pass with 100% success rate.

### Deployment

```bash
# 1. Deploy Firestore rules
firebase deploy --only firestore:rules

# 2. Deploy Cloud Functions
cd functions
npm install
cd ..
firebase deploy --only functions:validateUserCreation,functions:auditAdminAccounts

# 3. Verify deployment
firebase functions:list
firebase firestore:rules list

# 4. Monitor logs
firebase functions:log --only validateUserCreation
```

---

## Monitoring & Alerts

### Where to Check for Security Incidents

**Firestore Console:**
```
Collection: securityIncidents
Query: Order by 'detectedAt' DESC
```

**Types of incidents logged:**
- `PRIVILEGE_ESCALATION_ATTEMPT` - Real-time detection of unauthorized admin creation
- `UNAUTHORIZED_ADMIN_ACCOUNTS_DETECTED` - Daily audit findings

**Cloud Function Logs:**
```bash
# Real-time monitor
firebase functions:log --only validateUserCreation

# Daily audit
firebase functions:log --only auditAdminAccounts
```

### Security Incident Response

If a security incident is detected:

1. **Immediate Actions:**
   - Account is automatically disabled (no user action needed)
   - Admin privileges are automatically revoked
   - Incident is logged with full details

2. **Investigation:**
   - Review `securityIncidents` collection for incident details
   - Check user's registration timestamp and IP address
   - Review `adminLogs` for any suspicious activity

3. **Remediation:**
   - If false positive: Re-enable account via Firebase Console
   - If confirmed attack: Keep account disabled, report to security team
   - Review access logs for any data accessed before detection

## Legitimate Admin Creation

Admin privileges can ONLY be granted through:

1. **First Admin Initialization** (one-time):
   ```javascript
   const initializeFirstAdmin = httpsCallable(functions, 'initializeFirstAdmin');
   await initializeFirstAdmin();
   ```
   - Only works if NO admins exist
   - Sets `adminGrantedBy: 'SYSTEM_INIT'`

2. **Admin-to-Admin Grant** (ongoing):
   ```javascript
   const setAdminRole = httpsCallable(functions, 'setAdminRole');
   await setAdminRole({ targetUserId: userId, isAdmin: true });
   ```
   - Requires caller to be existing admin
   - Sets `adminGrantedBy: <admin_uid>`

3. **Admin Dashboard Toggle** (UI):
   - Use Admin Dashboard → User Management
   - Toggle admin switch for target user
   - Calls `adminToggleAdmin` Cloud Function

All legitimate methods:
- ✅ Use Firebase Admin SDK (server-side)
- ✅ Bypass security rules (authorized)
- ✅ Create audit trail
- ✅ Set Firebase Custom Claims
- ✅ Log action to `adminLogs`

---

## Rollback Plan

If issues arise after deployment:

### 1. Rollback Firestore Rules
```bash
firebase firestore:rules:list  # Find previous version
firebase firestore:rules:release <previous-version-id>
```

### 2. Disable Cloud Functions
```bash
firebase functions:delete validateUserCreation
firebase functions:delete auditAdminAccounts
```

### 3. Emergency Admin Access
- Use Firebase Console to manually modify user documents
- Use `initializeFirstAdmin()` to bootstrap new admin if needed
