### Prerequisites
1. Firebase emulators running: `npm run emulators:start`
2. Firebase credentials configured
3. Test user credentials available
4. Postman/curl/Thunder Client ready

## 6️⃣ Firestore Data Verification

### Manual Firestore Console Checks

1. **Open Firebase Console** → Firestore Database

2. **Check Users Collection:**
   ```
   /users/{userId}
   - Verify userId is Firebase UID (NOT database UUID)
   - Verify user documents exist
   ```

3. **Check Listings Collection:**
   ```
   /cargoListings/{listingId}
   - Verify userId field matches Firebase UID
   - NO userId: undefined values
   ```

4. **Check Bids Collection:**
   ```
   /bids/{bidId}
   - Verify bidderId matches Firebase UID
   - Verify listingOwnerId matches Firebase UID
   ```

5. **Check Notifications Subcollection:**
   ```
   /users/{userId}/notifications/{notificationId}
   - Verify notifications are in correct user's subcollection
   - Verify structure matches expected format
   ```

6. **Check Chat Messages Subcollection:**
   ```
   /bids/{bidId}/messages/{messageId}
   - Verify senderId matches Firebase UID
   - Verify messages are in correct bid's subcollection
   ```

## 7️⃣ Regression Tests

### Test 7.1: Existing Functionality Still Works
- ✅ User login/logout
- ✅ Listing creation/update/delete
- ✅ Bid creation/acceptance/rejection
- ✅ Chat messaging
- ✅ Notifications delivery
- ✅ Rating submission
- ✅ Contract creation

### Test 7.2: No Sequelize References
```bash
# Search for any remaining Sequelize imports
rg -n "require\\('sequelize'\\)" functions/src
# Should return: no matches

rg -n "from 'sequelize'" functions/src
# Should return: no matches

# Search for old user ID pattern
rg -n "req\\.user\\.id[^.]" functions/src
# Should return: no matches (only req.user.uid)
```

## 🚨 Critical Failure Scenarios

If ANY of these occur, DO NOT DEPLOY:

1. **Security Failure:**
   - Unauthorized user can access other users' chats
   - Unauthorized user can modify other users' resources
   - Authorization checks return 200 instead of 403

2. **Data Integrity Failure:**
   - New records have `userId: undefined`
   - Ownership checks fail for valid owners
   - Records are created in wrong collections

3. **Runtime Failure:**
   - Server crashes on startup
   - `require() of ES Module` errors
   - Sequelize-related errors

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### Issue: 403 Forbidden on Valid Requests
**Cause:** Token not being sent or invalid
**Fix:** Check Authorization header format: `Bearer YOUR_TOKEN`

### Issue: 404 User Not Found
**Cause:** User document doesn't exist in Firestore
**Fix:** Verify user was created via Firebase Auth, check Firestore console

### Issue: userId: undefined in Database
**Cause:** Route still using `req.user.id` instead of `req.user.uid`
**Fix:** Check the specific route file and update to `req.user.uid`

### Issue: Server Won't Start
**Cause:** Sequelize imports still present
**Fix:** Check for remaining `require('sequelize')` calls
