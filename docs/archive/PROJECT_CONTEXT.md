# PROJECT_CONTEXT.md
## KARGA Connect - Philippine Trucking Backload Marketplace

> **Generated**: February 21, 2026
> **Purpose**: Current architecture and implementation reference for ongoing development

---

## 1. Project Status Summary

KARGA Connect is currently a **Firebase-first** marketplace platform:
- Frontend: React + Vite SPA (PWA-capable)
- Backend runtime: Firebase Cloud Functions (Node 22)
- Data: Firestore, Firebase Auth, Firebase Storage
- Real-time updates: Firestore listeners (`onSnapshot`)

Recent local updates (Feb 21, 2026) include admin platform-fee monitoring refinements:
- `adminGetOutstandingFees` ordering/sorting hardening in `functions/src/api/admin.js`
- overdue display edge-case fixes in `frontend/src/views/admin/PaymentsView.jsx`
- index addition in `firestore.indexes.json` for `contracts` (`platformFeePaid`, `platformFeeDueDate`)

## 4. Frontend Architecture

### App Composition
- `frontend/src/main.jsx` boots React, PWA SW registration, and Sentry init.
- `frontend/src/App.jsx` wraps app with `AuthProvider`, handles new-user registration routing, and supports guest-first entry.
- `frontend/src/GetGoApp.jsx` is the active primary application shell (`USE_NEW_UI = true`).

### State and Data Flow
- Auth/profile state: `frontend/src/contexts/AuthContext.jsx`
- Firestore subscription hooks: listings, bids, notifications, contracts, shipments
- Marketplace UI state hooks: filters, tabs, modals, theme, media query
- API abstraction: `frontend/src/services/api.js`
  - Cloud Functions via `httpsCallable`
  - direct Firestore reads for some user-scoped data

### Real-Time Behavior
- `frontend/src/hooks/useSocket.js` is a compatibility layer now powered by Firestore listeners.
- Socket-like emit methods are no-op placeholders to avoid breaking existing call sites.

### Major Frontend Domains
- Marketplace listings: cargo + truck flows
- Bidding + chat + contracts lifecycle
- GCash payment submission and status views
- Broker onboarding/referrals/payouts
- Admin dashboard and admin management views

---

## 5. Cloud Functions Architecture

### Entry Point
- `functions/index.js` wires all callable functions, HTTP handlers, triggers, and scheduled tasks.

### Callable/API Domains (`functions/src/api`)
- `admin.js`: dashboard, user controls, disputes, listings moderation, contracts/fees reports, broker admin ops
- `auth.js`: role switching
- `recovery.js`: account recovery codes and recovery sign-in
- `contracts.js`: contract lifecycle
- `wallet.js`: GCash orders, pending orders, config
- `shipments.js`: shipment updates
- `ratings.js`: rating submission + pending ratings
- `referrals.js`: broker registration/referral/payout operations
- `listings.js`: backload discovery + listing chat request

### Trigger Domains (`functions/src/triggers`)
- Bids: creation/status/acceptance events
- Shipments: location/status events
- Ratings: post-rating side effects
- Referrals: platform-fee completion referral effects

### Scheduled Jobs (`functions/src/scheduled`)
- Platform fee reminder scheduler
- Security audit scheduler in `functions/index.js`

### HTTP Functions
- `getRoute`: proxy to OpenRouteService for routing
- `geocode`: proxy for search/autocomplete/reverse geocoding

---

## 6. Data Model and Security

### Core Firestore Collections
- `users` (+ `shipperProfile`, `truckerProfile`, `brokerProfile`, `wallet`, `notifications`)
- `cargoListings`, `truckListings`
- `bids` (+ `messages`)
- `contracts`
- `shipments`
- `ratings`
- `orders`, `paymentSubmissions`, `platformFees`
- broker/referral/payout collections

### Security Posture (`firestore.rules`)
- Default model is authenticated access for marketplace operations.
- Listing reads (`cargoListings`, `truckListings`) require authentication.
- Admin actions are server-authoritative and validated via role/custom-claim checks.
- Payment submission security includes screenshot URL trust checks and ownership validation.
- Debt/suspension controls are enforced in rules for bid acceptance and fee exposure.

### Indexing
- Composite indexes managed in `firestore.indexes.json`.
- Recent relevant index: `contracts(platformFeePaid ASC, platformFeeDueDate ASC)`.

---

## 7. Styling and Design Tokens

### Tailwind Setup
- Tailwind v4 entry: `frontend/src/styles/tailwind.css`
- Theme tokens + custom utilities: `frontend/src/styles/theme.css`
- Global imports and resets: `frontend/src/index.css`
- Brand font import: `frontend/src/styles/fonts.css` (`Outfit`)

### Current Visual Direction
- Orange-forward primary brand palette
- Gradient utility classes for role/status emphasis
- Light/dark tokenized theme support
- Glassmorphism utility variants in shared token layer

---

## 8. Build, Run, and Test Workflow

### Root (`package.json`)
- `npm run test:e2e`
- `npm run test:e2e:ui`
- `npm run test:e2e:headed`
- `npm run test:e2e:debug`
- `npm run test:e2e:report`
- `npm run test:verify`

### Frontend (`frontend/package.json`)
- `npm run dev`
- `npm run build`
- `npm run lint`

### Functions (`functions/package.json`)
- `npm run serve`
- `npm run deploy`
- `npm run logs`
- `npm run test`

### Emulator Ports (`firebase.json`)
- Auth: `9099`
- Firestore: `8080`
- Functions: `5001`
- Storage: `9199`
- Emulator UI: `4000`

## 9. Known Context Risks / Follow-ups

- Legacy Express backend references were cleaned from active setup/runtime docs.
- `frontend/src/GetGoApp.jsx` still uses socket-oriented naming in some comments/variables, but implementation is Firestore-based.
- `frontend/src/firebase.js` still includes fallback Firebase config values; environment-based config remains recommended for all deployments.
- E2E docs are aligned with the current Firebase-first architecture.
